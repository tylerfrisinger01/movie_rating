This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. This is required to run React apps.

Then, in your terminal, cd into this project's root folder and start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running locally.

In another terminal, enter `cd src`, then `cd backend` and then run `node server.js` in order to start the backend server.

The application should now be running and you are able to interact with its database.
